The script run_analysis.R downloads files associatd with an experiment involving 30 subjects performing six different activities while wearing a smartphone that collected accelerometer and gyroscopic data. The cript compiles the files downloaded into a single table, and then trims the table down into a table of only theaverage for the mean and standard deviation measurements.  

1. The first step it top download the dataset into the folder UCI HAR Dataset.

2. The files downloaded are read into a variety of data frames using read.table(), and some of the frames are assigned column headings.

3.  The data frames are merged using cbind() and rbind().

4. A new frame is made by using select() from the dpylr package in order to select only the mean and standard variation variables.

5. The codes in the new data frame are changed from numerical activity codes into the descriptive activity names.

6. The titles of the variables are modified using gsub() to make them more descriptive.

7. The resulting table is written into a file using write.table().
